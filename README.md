# DevLeagueRound5

Hot Air Balloon where you have a flare gun and have to shoot random wooden things in order to keep rising

Perhaps some weird ass birds are attacking
The birds are trying to prevent you from turning off their anti gravity gun

Lower your health, slower your rise


Main things we need:
- Collecting flares - Nathan
- Lighting fires/updrafts - Nathan
- Bird Enemies - Nathan
- Start/End Game - Nathan
- Entrance scene (basic text box!) - Nathan
